 The script finds all tags for welded joints. If they do not contain the letter z, it adds it. 
 To run the script, you need to open file “Run_Script_from_Admin.py”, because script requires admin rights to clicks in Tekla. 
 When you start the script, you must to be in drawing and press “home” key on keyboard and have the required mark selected by default.

There are 2 log files. 
The first for the model (marks are written in the format “B-6”). 
The second log is for drawings (marks are written in the format “B.6”) 
This is needed for searching in different menus.
